## Can I Use McDonald’s Gift Cards for Delivery Orders Through Apps?
McDonald’s gift cards, also known as Arch Cards, are a popular choice for enjoying delicious meals. However, their use for delivery orders through apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, or the McDonald’s app can vary based on several factors.
Using McDonald’s Gift Cards for Delivery
Currently, McDonald’s gift cards can be used in-store and at drive-thru locations, but they are not universally accepted for delivery orders placed through third-party apps like Uber Eats or DoorDash.
